            "source": "\n\nBerlin city is one of the German\u2019s federal states. It consists of twelve boroughs each with its own local government, under Berlin\u2019s city and state government. Each borough is governed by a council with five councilors and a borough mayor. Each borough is made up of several officially recognized neighborhoods/localities. These neighborhoods/ localities do not have their own governmental bodies, but are recognized by the city and the boroughs for planning and statistical purposes. It is beneficial for each borough council to have an effective plan on improving the infrastructure of its localities within a year. This will also help the city government to allocate funds appropriately and ultimately improve the living standards and well-being of the inhabitants. In order to achieve this it is advantageous to predict and identify the behavior of inhabitants within localities of each borough, most popular areas, venues, activities etc. This will in turn help the borough council to identify what, where and how to plan on improving the underlying infrastructure to facilitate its people.\n\n",

Therefore, it is critical for the local government of each borough to identify the most effective ways, such as on what, where and how to utilize the allocated funds. \n\nLocation data is freely available and easily accessible. Analyzing the location data within the city of Berlin can be used to identify the most popular and trending clusters/ venues among the inhabitants of each locality in each borough. This information will help to identify the common behavioral patterns of inhabitants including popular sports, other leisure activities and places where most people like to spend time during their free time  specially on weekends, E.g. popular places of eating etc. \n\nLocal governments like borough councils can utilize this information in their yearly planing and fund management processes in order to effectively and efficiently plan and manage their funds allocated to improve underlying infrastructure to uplift living standards of its inhabitants and ensure well-being in terms of  physical and mental health, safely, comfort etc.\n\n",

Using Foursquare API popular venues were selected for each locality. 10 most popular venues and venue categories were identified using that data and stored in python dataframes for detailed analyses.
